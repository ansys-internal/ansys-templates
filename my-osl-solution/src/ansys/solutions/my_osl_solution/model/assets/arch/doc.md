# WebApp example for optimization of a steel hook
-------------------------------------------------
( a Python based optiSLang Web Application )

The task is to design a steel hook such that:
+ The mass is as small as possible.
+ The von-Mises stress under the given load does not exceed a limit to be input.
+ Certain geometry parameters are within the bounds to be input.
+ The maximum number of designs used in this optimization can be limited.

In ANSYS Workbench the ANSYS Mechanical is used as solver.
